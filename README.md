Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) has had a great success in the recent past, because of the advent of faster GPUs and
memory access. CNNs are really powerful as they learn the features from data in layers such that they exhibit the structure of
the V-1 features of the human brain. A huge bottleneck in this case is that CNNs are very large and have a very high memory
footprint, and hence they cannot be employed on devices with limited storage such as mobile phone, IoT etc. In this work we
study the model complexity vs accuracy trade-off on MNSIT dataset, and give a concrete framework of handling such a problem, given the worst
case accuracy that a system can tolerate.
